# Fairytale

A complete project designed to apply **style transfer** to images, videos, and audio, with the goal of generating high quality videos that demonstrate the creative power of this technique.

### Version 1 â€“ Image-based Style Transfer

In the first version, the project focuses on style transfer for images.  
It works by:
1. Extracting frames from a video.
2. Applying style transfer to each frame individually.
3. Reconstructing the final video from the styled frames.

Stay tuned for future updates that will include video and audio based style transfer!
